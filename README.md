# FeaturEng

_created by Austin Poor_

`featureng` (pronounced _featur-ing_) is a library for feature engineering.

I wanted to create a library to store tools to help in the feature engineering
process â€“ by extracting information from existing data or by simplifying the
process of adding in external data.
